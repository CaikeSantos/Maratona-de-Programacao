<h1>Maratona de Programação</h1>
<p>The Programming Marathon is a UFSCar project aimed at training and preparing students for competitive programming competitions</p>

<h3>Context:</h3>
<p>Throughout the week, themes are selected within programming, such as sorting algorithms. Following a lecture and discussion on the topic, selected activities related to the theme are assigned to deepen understanding and expand the range of exercises.

One of the benefits that the marathon offers its participants is not only competition but also the solidification of concepts from basic to advanced within computing. Additionally, it fosters the evolution of programming logic, which is one of the main foundations of a skilled programmer.</p>
